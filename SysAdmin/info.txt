Hey there,

Just a heads-up on the API security:

    Authentication's sorted with a token.
    Routes are in place for info retrieval and command execution. Watch out, though, **/send-command** could be an open door for malicious commands.
    Error handling's basic, but not too revealing. Could use some beefing up.
    CORS is enabled, but it's wide open. Might wanna tighten that up.

Suggestions:

    Secure token handling: Think JWT or OAuth2.
    Tighten up input validation to block any funny business.
    Consider role-based access for added security layers.
    Keep sensitive info out of the codebase.
	Remember that attackers have multiple **methods** of ganing the same information about us

Stay sharp! Let's beef up that security.

Cheers,
